## ‚ùì How to Use
1. Download the latest release from the link below.
2. Extract `D.A.R.K Launcher.exe` to a new folder.
3. Run the executable:
   - **First Run**: A GUI will prompt you to set the game path (`REPO.exe`) and DLL path (`r.e.p.o.cheat.dll`).
   - **Subsequent Runs**: Auto-downloads updates and injects if configured.
4. Use commands (e.g., `inject 5`) for manual control if needed.

## üìã Commands
- `inject [time] [--force]`: Inject the DLL after `[time]` seconds; `--force` overrides auto-inject restrictions.
- `kill`: Terminate the REPO process.
- `restart [time]`: Kill and restart the game with an optional delay.
- `auto_inject [true/false] [time]`: Toggle auto-injection and set wait time.
- `inject_wait_time`: Open GUI to set injection delay.
- `status`: Show current configuration and game status.
- `download_dll <url>`: Download a DLL from a specified URL.
- `help`: Display this list.

## üôÖ Disclaimer
This is an **automated launcher**. Any injection failures are due to the injector (`smi.exe`) or DLL (`r.e.p.o.cheat.dll`), not the launcher itself. We only take responsibility for launcher-specific errors.
